# W8D4 -- Discuss ES5 and continue TDD



## ES5 vs ES6 Exercises

- ES6 is for the MOST part syntactic sugar
- syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to
 make things easier to read or to express
- Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object which sits just below
  null on the top of a prototype chain.
- Cannot define constructor with an arrow function!
