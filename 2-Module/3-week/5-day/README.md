# W9D5

## We'll begin today by working with pairs to complete the following practices:

### Array Problems Long Practice (1 Hour)

This practice is **important** since it not only let's us review Big O,
but it also let's us flex our **problem solving** and **debugging**
skills which will be **very** important to polish for the upcoming weeks.
- Get in the habit of console.logging everything.
- If you're not sure *what* to console.log **ask a question**.
- Keep it simple: use good ole' fashion for loops.

Please work through these problems following the below 3 steps:
1. Complete all of the Problems.
2. Evaluate their time and space complexity.
3. After steps 1 and 2, try to refactor for better time complexity.
