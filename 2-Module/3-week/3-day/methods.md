# Array practice

Identify the time complexity of each of these functions with a 1 sentence
justification for your answer. Assume `arr` is an array of length _n_.

## `arr.push()`

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Adding to the end of the array, by utilizing .length property
Worst case: O(n) time complexity
and happens in place.

[push on MDN][push]


## `arr.pop()`

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Removing from the end of the array, by utilizing .length property
and happens in place.

[pop on MDN][pop]

## `arr.shift()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Removing from the front requires all other values to be shifted to
left by 1, but this happens in place.

[shift on MDN][shift]

## `arr.unshift()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Adding to the front requires all other values to be shifted to
right by 1, but this happens in place.

[unshift on MDN][unshift]

## `arr.splice()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)****O(1)????
Justification: Splice will remove elements, in the case in the middle of an array,
will require shifting, but this mutates original array, but returns a new array.

## `arr.slice()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Justification: Slice will remove elements, this is making a new array, and each element
gets indexed in this new array.

## `arr.indexOf()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: This will visit each element in the array, but not create extra space.

[indexOf on MDN][indexOf]

## `arr.map()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Justification: Assuming the callback is constant time complexity, we iterate over the array, performing operations for each element, returning a new array.

[map on MDN][map]

## `arr.filter()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Justification: Assuming the callback is constant time complexity, we iterate over the array, performing operations for each element, returning a new array.

[filter on MDN][filter]

## `arr.reduce()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Reduce applies a reducer function to each elemnt in the array.
Assuming time complexity of the acculumator is constant, and this is in place.

[reduce on MDN][reduce]

## `arr.reverse()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Reverse will move n elements in-place.

[reverse on MDN][reverse]

## `[...arr]`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Justification: This will copy all n elements in to the new array of length n.
