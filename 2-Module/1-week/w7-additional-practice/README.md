# Class Creation Practice: Movies, Actors, and Genres

Welcome to this exercise on class creation. Your challenge is to construct classes that represent movies, their genres, and actors. Through this exercise, you'll practice developing classes based on test specifications.

## Objective

Your task is to interpret the provided test specs and build the corresponding classes. As you work, use the test specifications as your guide. The end goal is to have classes that make all the provided test specs pass.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
2. **Examine the Test Specs**: Dive deep into the provided test specs. They will give you clues and direction on how to structure your classes and their functionalities.
3. **Install the Dependencies**: Use the command `npm install` to install the dependencies needed for testing.
4. **Run Tests**: Use the command `npm test` to run the test specs. Initially, all tests will be failing. Your challenge? Turn those red lines green by building your folder, files, and classes!

## Guidelines

- The test specs will hint at the properties and methods each class should have. Read them carefully!
- I included comments to help explain what is going on in certain places.
- You'll come across a few unconventional cases.  These are intended to help us revisit previous concepts.
- Try doing a single "it" block at a time. Build a bit, test a bit, and refine.
