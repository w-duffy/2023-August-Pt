/*Recursion and Array Exercise: Finding the Longest Name

In a universe far far away, a group of people are in a debate on who has the longest name. Your task is to help them find out.

Instructions:

Write a recursive function called longestNameFinder that takes in two arguments:

names: An array of strings representing names.
currLongest: A string representing the current longest name.  It defaults to an empty string.

Examples:
//  console.log(longestNameFinder(["Bob", "Jill", "Will", "Andres"])); // 'Andres'
//  console.log(longestNameFinder(["sally", "beth", "reallyLongName", "yoda", 'luke'])); // 'reallyLongName'

The function should return the longest name from the array." */

function longestNameFinder(names, currLongest="") {

  }


  console.log(longestNameFinder(["Bob", "Jill", "Will", "Andres"])); // 'Andres'
  console.log(longestNameFinder(["sally", "beth", "reallyLongName", "yoda", 'luke'])); // 'reallyLongName'
