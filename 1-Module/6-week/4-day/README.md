In JavaScript (and many programming languages), expressions, statements, and declarations are fundamental constructs, but they are not the only constructs. When diving deeper into the language, you'll encounter various other terminologies and constructs. Here's a brief breakdown:

1. **Expressions**: Expressions produce a value and can be written wherever a value is expected.

2. **Statements**: Statements perform actions. They represent things to be done. Every expression can be a statement, but not every statement is an expression.

3. **Declarations**: These introduce an identifier and possibly assign it a value, like with variables or functions.

Beyond these:

4. **Literals**: These represent fixed values in the language. For example:
   - Number literals: `123`, `3.14`
   - String literals: `'Hello'`, `"World"`
   - Array literals: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Object literals: `{ key: 'value' }`
   - RegExp literals: `/\d+/`

5. **Operators**: Operators act on values (the operands) and produce a new value. Examples include:
   - Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
   - Comparison operators: `==`, `===`, `>`, `<`
   - Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
   - Ternary operator: `? :`

6. **Keywords**: Reserved words that have special meanings. Examples include:
   - Control flow: `if`, `else`, `switch`, `break`, `continue`
   - Loops: `for`, `while`, `do`
   - Others: `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `return`, `await`, `async`

7. **Control Structures**: These are constructs that decide which portions of the code get executed (or repeated). Examples include loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`) and conditionals (`if...else`, `switch`).

8. **Functions**: Beyond just declarations, functions can be first-class citizens in JavaScript. This means functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This leads to powerful concepts like:
   - Higher-order functions: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.
   - Callbacks: Functions passed to other functions to be executed later.
   - Closures: Functions that "remember" the environment in which they were created.

9. **Objects**: In JavaScript, nearly everything is an object. But when you delve into object-oriented aspects of JS, you'll encounter:
   - Constructors
   - Prototypes and Prototype Inheritance
   - ES6 Classes
   - Getters and Setters


This list doesn't exhaust everything, but it gives a broader view of the constructs and concepts you'll encounter. As one delves deeper into JavaScript (or any language), it becomes evident that the landscape is vast, rich, and multifaceted. The beauty of programming is that there's always something new to learn!
