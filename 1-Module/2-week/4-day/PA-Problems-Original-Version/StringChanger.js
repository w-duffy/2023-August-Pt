/*
String Changer
This problem is worth 5 points.
You may receive partial credit.
Build a function called stringChanger() that takes in two arguments: a word and an operation.
Based on the operation, your function will return the word modified in some way. The operations are:

"capitalize": Capitalize the first letter in the word.

"uppercase": Capitalize every letter in the word.

"double": Return the word twice in a row.

"reverse": Return the string with the letters in reverse order.

If the operation is invalid, return the word, unchanged.
*/

function stringChanger(word, operation) {
    // Your code here
}

// TESTS
// DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE

let score = 0;

if (stringChanger("foo", "capitalize") === "Foo") score++;
if (stringChanger("foo", "uppercase") === "FOO") score++;
if (stringChanger("foo", "double") === "foofoo") score++;
if (stringChanger("foo", "reverse") === "oof") score++;

if (stringChanger("foo", "unknown") === "foo") score++;

console.log("You have scored " + score + "/5 points.");
